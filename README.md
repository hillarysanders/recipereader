This is my recipe reader website. I hope it's going to be cool. If it is awesome enough to me to use, then I will be pleased. If it is awesome enough for other people to use, I will still be pleased, although I'll actually have to look into AWS billing. Ruh roh. So here's to crappy code? NEEEVAAAAH! (Unless it's a one off and deadlines call for it. But that doesn't apply here. So ha!)

Anyways.

Here are the current issues I'm working on! [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/hillarysanders/recipereader.png?label=ready&title=Issues Ready Fo Dev!)](http://waffle.io/hillarysanders/recipereader)

When this website is actually usable I'll add more to this README. 

Luv ya'lls <3.
