Yahoo!
This is my recipe reader website. I hope it's going to be cool. If it is awesome enough to me to use, then I will be pleased. If it is awesome enough for other people to use, I will still be pleased, although I'll actually have to look into AWS billing. Ruh roh. So here's to crappy code? NEEEVAAAAH!

Anyways.

Here are the current issues I'm working on!

When this website is actually usable I'll add more to this README. 

Luv ya'lls <3.
